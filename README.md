# Statistical-Methods

This project provides an optimized prediction algorithm using machine learning regression techniques for house prices.

Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XGBoost) have been tested on the dataset.

I used Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Sikit-Learn, and Seaborn libraries.
